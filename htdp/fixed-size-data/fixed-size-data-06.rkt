; Main function example
(define (letter fst lst signature-name)
  (string-append
   (opening fst)
   "\n\n"
   (body fst lst)
   "\n\n"
   (closing signature-name)))

; Helper function example
(define (opening fst)
  (string-append "Dear " fst ","))

(define (body fst lst)
  (string-append
   "We have discovered that all people with the " "\n"
   "last name " lst " have won our lottery. So, " "\n"
   fst ", " "hurry and pick up your prize"))

(define (closing signature-name)
  (string-append
   "Sincerely,"
   "\n\n"
   signature-name
   "\n"))

; Now, run the function
(letter "Bobby" "Charlton" "Babs")

; Enter this into cli
; â€” Consider 'stdout as a String for now ...
; (write-file 'stdout (letter "Matt" "Fiss" "Fell"))  ; #2
