;; ======================
;;
;; != Constants should really be `graphic` and `world`
;; != Utility functions should pass values (not instances)
;; != Repeating the (make-vcat ...) function a lot here
;; != Not sure if conflating two values in (move-cat ...) is a bad idea?
;;    + probably split out into TWO conditional functions?
;;
;; #1: Start the animation again
;;     != I think you only need to "make a vcat" in this one place?
