;;;; 6.4 Checking the world
;;;; ======================
;;;; What went wrong?
;;;;
;;;; A full program has lots of moving parts and
;;;; lots of room for error (somewhere in the chain)
;;;;
;;;; #1: If any world state returns anything except a Number
;;;;     an error is flagged.
;;;;
;;;; #2: Something a bit more useful than a data-definition
;;;;     i.e: is it in range of an interval?
