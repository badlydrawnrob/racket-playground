;;;; 6.4 Checking the world
;;;; ======================
;;;; What went wrong?
;;;;
;;;; A full program has lots of moving parts and
;;;; lots of room for error (somewhere in the chain)
;;;;
;;;; #1: If any world state returns anything except a Number
;;;;     an error is flagged.
;;;;
;;;; #2: Something a bit more useful than a data-definition
;;;;     i.e: is it in range of an interval?
;;;;
;;;; #3: See also "HTDP Answers"
;;;;     @link: https://bit.ly/2lUmBT7 (one example, slightly different from mine)

;; World State is a Number range
;; -----------------------------
;; You can check with a more nuanced functions

; A UnitWorld is a number
;   between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive)

; Any -> Boolean
; is x between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive)
