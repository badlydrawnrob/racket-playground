;;
;; ‚ö†Ô∏è See README for applicative- vs normal-order evaluation,

;;; 1.1.7 =====================================================

;; Square roots by Newton's method
;; Pseudo lisp to showing a problem that describes 'what it is',
;; but not how to compute it. It shows the property of a thing,
;; not the 'how to' of the thing.

; (define (sqrt x)
;   (the y (and (>= y 0)
;               (= (square y) x))))

;; Whenever we have a guess for y for the value of the square
;; root of a number x, we can perform a simple manipulation to
;; get a better guess (one closer to the actual square root)
;; by averaging y with x/y. For example, we can compute the
;; square root of 2 as follows. Suppose our initial guess is 1:
;;
;; - https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/quotient/

; guess    quotient     average
;
; <guess>  (2/<guess>)  ((2 + <guess>) / 2)
;
; 1        (2/1)        ((2 + 1) / 2)
;            = 2           =  1.5
;
; 1.5      (2/1.5)      ((1.3333 + 1.5) / 2)
;            = 1.3333     = 1.4167
;
; 1.4167    ...         ...


;; WISHFUL THINKING:
;;
;; From our table, we can formalize the process with a procedure.
;; We use 'wishful thinking' to make a start on our function ...
;;
;; - A little bit like HTDP function recipe, but we're writing
;;   out the template function as if the child functions already exist,
;;   without worrying yet HOW to compute them. (see README)

(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess x)
      guess
      (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))

;; Now continue to flesh out the child functions ...

(define (improve guess x)
  (average guess (/ x guess)))

;; Now we need the average function to make `improve` work ...

(define (average x y)
  (/ (+ x y) 2))

;; Let's test those two functions:

(average 1 2) ; => 1.5
(improve 1 2) ; => (average 1 (/ 2 1)) => (average 1 2) => ...


;; `sqrt-iter` still won't run until we've declared
;; the `good-enough?` function
;;
;; ‚ÄúThe idea is to improve the answer until it is close
;; enough so that its square differs from the radicand by less than a
;; predetermined tolerance (here 0.001)‚Äù
;;
;; - https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/radicand.html

(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))

;; We also need the `square` function to use `good-enough?`

(define (square n)
  (* n n))

(square 2) ; => 4

;; Now we can run the `good-enough?` function ...

(good-enough? 1 2)            ; => . (square 1) . => . (- 1 2) . => . (abs -1) . => (< 1 0.001) => #f
(good-enough? 1.5 2)          ; => #f
(good-enough? 1.4142135624 2) ; => #t


;; And finally run the whole damn thing ...

(sqrt-iter 1 2) ; => 1.5 => 1.4167 => ... so on ...


;; Wrap it all up in a better function name:
;;
;; let's set the guess always starting at `1.0`
;; - Using a floating point number returns a floating point (not a mixed fraction)

(define (sqrt x)
  (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))

(sqrt 9) ; => 3.00009155413138


;;; Exercise 1.6 =================================================================
;;
;; Alyssa P. Hacker doesn‚Äôt see why if needs to be provided as a special form.
;; ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of cond?‚Äù

(define (new-if predicate 
                then-clause 
                else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))

(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5) ; => 5
(new-if (= 2 2) 0 5) ; => 0

;; ‚ÄúDelighted, Alyssa uses new-if to rewrite the square-root program:‚Äù

(define (sqrt-iter-new-if guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter-new-if (improve guess x) x)))

;; Alyssa realises that running this function creates an infinite loop:
;; - http://community.schemewiki.org/?sicp-ex-1.6
;;
;; Only one of the two consequent expressions get evaluated when using `if`,
;; while both of the consequent expressions get evaluated with `new-if`.
;;
;; See file `excercise-1.1.6-infinite-loop.rkt`


;;; ‚ö†Ô∏è Exercise 1.7 =================================================================
;;
;; I'm not sure how to change the function for these fringe cases.
;; - http://community.schemewiki.org/?sicp-ex-1.7
;;
;; `good-enough?` test won't be very effective for very small, or very large numbers.
;; ‚Äî¬†the numbers below don't match up!!
