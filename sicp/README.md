# SICP

> **SICP is maths-heavy and I've no interest in improving my maths** (much) so expect maths questions to go unanswered, or refer to other people's answers. It's good to understand the general idea, if you can. Some [criticism](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1485363) and [helpful guidelines](https://jakescruggs.blogspot.com/2014/02/sicp-wasnt-written-for-you.html) for dealing with the book.
>
> An easier text, with less maths is [How To Design Programs](https://htdp.org/). ([a text](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/jfp2004-fffk.pdf) on the difference between the two)

## How to read the book

1. Set a timebox for each exercise
2. If you don't get it, look it up and move on to the next problem
3. Circle back to exercises you struggled with

## ‚úèÔ∏è Designing programs / functions

- **[Wishful thinking](https://wiki.c2.com/?WishfulThinking)** and **[HTDP function recipes](https://htdp.org/2019-02-24/part_one.html#%28part._sec~3adesign-func%29)** (simpler description [here](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/debugging-with-htdp-design-recipe)) ‚Äî¬†design your function as if procedures already exist.
